# nzdt_standards
An attempt to collate information about NZ Technology Achievement Standards.

The goal is to take the info for a standard from nzqa, tki, and anywhere else relevant and it put it all together on one page. Eventually I'd like to scrape the information directly but that will be a challenge as URLs are inconsistent and a lot is stored in pdf only.

## Technology
This is also a learning experience, the app has been developed on node.js with a bunch of useful modules (most notably [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [express-hbs](https://github.com/barc/express-hbs)) and uses hbs to put the pages together. Not sure why but I also decided I wanted to try a new framework (I only really have experiece with bootstrap) so the pages use [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) which I've underutilised, but give me time.
